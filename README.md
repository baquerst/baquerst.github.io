# Hi, I'm Bryan :)

I'm a 4th year Cognitive Science: Design and Interaction student at UCSD with a Computer Science minor. [Here is a link to my online portfolio](https://www.bryanxlee.com/) that contains some of my previous work.

Some of my favorite programming languages are listed below from most to least liked
1. Java
2. C
3. HTML
4. Python

I ranked Java as my most liked programming language because of how familiar I am with it. It was the first programming language I learned, so I feel I have the most knowledge in this language. Writing ```public static void main(String[] args)``` feels natural to me.

Right now, I have aspirations to become a UX designer or Front-end developer but I still have a ways to go. Below is a list of the accomplishments I have achieved and hope to achieve in the future.
- [x] Attend a university
- [x] Complete a project related to my field
- [ ] Gain industry experience
- [ ] Get a full time role in industry

## Personal Life
When I'm not studying or putting time into coding, I like to play video games and watch anime.

Some games I enjoy playing, and my rank in them, include
- League of Legends
  - ~~Diamond~~ Gold
- Valorant
  - Bronze  
- Genshin Impact

One of my favorite animes I've watched, *NANA* includes a quote from the protagonist Nana Osaki where she says
> Don't just give up. Life is about getting knocked down over and over, but still getting up each time. If you keep getting up, you win.
This quote helps remind me that failures are a part of every process in life, and that it shouldn't discourage me but instead keep me motivated to reach my end goal.
